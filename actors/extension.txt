Problem: We always here about celebrity couples, but have you ever wondered
 “how did they meet?” Sure they know a lot of people who probably could set them
  up, but who wants to embarrassingly ask hundreds of people if they know
  so-and-so? So they must find the easiest and most efficient people to ask,
   only people who can actually set them up, or at least introduce them to
   someone who can! This is precisely what ./extension does. It gives the
   desperate actor a step-by-step network of people that they know who can
   set them up with their celeb crush.


How we solved it: The program utilizes a list of actors and the movies that
 they have been in. From this, the program determines who knows who based
 on acting in the same movie. It creates a network of actors and actresses.
 It then determines who the desperate actor knows, who those people know, and
  so on until somebody knows the actor/actress whom the seeker is seeking. It
   uses a searching algorithm known as Djikstra’s to determine if an
   actor/actress could eventually find enough connections to meet the person
    they seek. The program realizes that you can only ask one person at a time,
     and allows you to input their response once you ask them.


How we tested: The best way to test is to run the program,
alternating “yes” and “no” responses, which test various
 scenarios that could arise in real life. The program is
 based off of the actor/actress going to other actor/actresses
 and asking if they will introduce them to someone else. Inputting
  various pairs of actors/actresses in the input file was key to
   figuring out if the matchmaker was working.

How to run: The command:

./extension [file name of actor/movies] [the file name of the input pair] [year you want to be matched]

1 [file name of actor/movies] : a tsv file in the form of Actor/Actress<TAB>Movie<TAB>Year that contains all the movies that an actor has been in (movie_casts.tsv)
2 [the file name of the input pair] : a tsv file in the form of Actor1<TAB>Actor2 where Actor1 is the actor/actress who wishes to be set up with Actor2
3 [year you want to be matched] : a year, the year in which the actor/actress wants to be matched

The program is in the First Person point of view, from the perspective of the
 actor/actress that wants to get setup. The program prompts user to make the
 decision of who they want to ask, as well as to input the response of other
 people. WARNING if you keep entering ‘y’ you may keep yourself in a loop
 because you are going to keep asking the same people, so you must work in
  some ’n’s. You will reach Actor2 eventually.
